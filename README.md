# Color Picking Compass

> Work in progress pet project

Color Picking Compass is a tool designed to explore the metaphor of the drawing compass, as it is used to draw
geometrically defined complex shapes starting with just a couple of dots on paper.

When applied to color spaces, this leads us to an approach of building palettes and schemes with a minimal input and
relying on common knowledge of color spaces properties.

### WIP

The project is heavily under development. Feel free to explore undocumented API surface.

### Example

Run `bun prepack ; bun example.ts` and check the output. It demonstrates how to use `color-picking-compass` by composing
some of provided functions.
